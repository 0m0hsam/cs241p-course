        <h2>Week 01 - Preparation Material</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For most weeks, the preparation material will consist of reading chapters from the text book. This week, however, is a little different because we will be getting set up with the CS Department Linux system and then learning the basics of Python from Web sources.</p>

        <h3>Tasks</h3>
        <p>Your main preparation tasks for the week are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p><a href="#linux">Get set up with the CS Department Linux System</a></p></li>
            <li><p><a href="#python">Learn the basics of Python</a></p></li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Get set up with the CS Department Linux System</h4>
        <p>We will use the CS Department Linux system for 2 main purposes: 1) to learn the basics of Linux commands and 2) to submit Python programs.</p>

        <p>In the past, the department has maintained a physical lab of computers for students to use and work with Linux (affectionately known as "The Linux Lab"). In order to accommodate many more students, both online and face-to-face, the department will still provide Linux servers, but students will now log into them remotely from their laptops.</p>

        <p>The way you remotely connect to the lab is different depending the type of computer you have. Please refer to the following link for information on configuring your specific system:

        <a name="python"></a>
        <h4>Learn the Basics of Python</h4>
        <p>This semester we will be using the Python programming language.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>You will demonstrate your preparation by taking a short preparation quiz and completing two checkpoint assignments.</p>
