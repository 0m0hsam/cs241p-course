        <p class="subtitle">Big-O Analysis</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this study, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Articulate the value of Big-O Analysis.</p></li>
            <li><p>Perform Big-O Analysis in simple situations.</p></li>
        </ol>            

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This semester we will be comparing many different data structures. In so doing, we may want to say "mine is better than yours" in one situation or another, but in order to do that we need to be able to explain or prove that it's true for certain conditions.</p>

        <p>This is where Big-O notation comes into play. It is the language and process we use to be able to rigorous define when something truly is faster or smaller than something else.</p>

        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>
        <p>Please read the following</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/article/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity" target="_BLANK">Big-O notation</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have a good understanding of this data structure and have completed the programming project, take the accompanying I-Learn Quiz. It has questions about how the data structure works, and also, has places for your to report on the parts of the programming assignment that you completed.</p>
