        <h2>03 Prepare : Reading</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This week your preparation material will come from our textbook, "Python 3 Object Oriented Programming" by Dusty Phillips. <a href="http://site.ebrary.com/lib/byuidaho/detail.action?docID=10442987#?" target="_BLANK">An electronic version of this book</a> is available for free via the university library's subscription.</p>
        <p>For this week, please read the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>From Chapter 1 (Object-oriented Design), read from the beginning up until, but not including, "Composition and Inheritance." In my version this is pages 7-17.</p></li>
            <li><p>From Chapter 2 (Objects in Python), read from the beginning up until, but not including, "Making it do something." In my version this is pages 33-35.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will read the rest of these chapters in future weeks, but for this week, the important concepts are to understand what classes and objects are, why they are useful, and how to define them in Python.</p>
