        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this week, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Show fluency in discussing object composition.</p></li>
            <li><p>Write programs that correctly use object composition solve problems.</p></li>
        </ol>            

        <p>This week we will dig deeper into our understanding of using class methods, and will also introduce the concept of objects that contain other objects, which is called <strong>Composition</strong>.</p>

        <h3>More with methods</h3>
        <p>As mentioned, we will begin using more objects and methods in more complicated and involved ways. To prepare for this, from <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/byui-cs241/ClassesBasics/toctree.html" target="_blank">Chapter 16</a>, please read the following sections</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>16.6. Adding Other Methods to our Class (Review this one from last week)</p></li>
            <li><p>16.7. Objects as Arguments and Parameters</p></li>
            <li><p>16.8. Converting an Object to a String</p></li>
            <li><p>16.9. Instances as Return Values</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Object composition</h3>

        <p>In additional to the reading from the online textbook, the following will introduce you to the idea of object composition.</p>

        <h4>Objects that contain more complicated data</h4>
