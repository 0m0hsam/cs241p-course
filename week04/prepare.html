        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>
        <p>This week your preparation material will come from our textbook, "Python 3 Object Oriented Programming" by Dusty Phillips. <a href="http://site.ebrary.com/lib/byuidaho/detail.action?docID=10442987#?" target="_BLANK">An electronic version of this book</a> is available for free via the university library's subscription.</p>

        <h4>Reading Assignment</h4>
        <p>For this week, please read the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Finish Chapter 2 (Objects in Python).</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>That is, from Chapter 2, read from the "Modules and Packages" to the end of the chapter. In my version, this is pages 43-62.</p>

        <h4>Advice in Reading</h4>
        <p>Some of the packages and modules reading gets a little technical. We will work through these ideas together. Through all the details, don't lose sight of the most important topics. They are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Classes can contain variables whose data type is another class (composition)</p></li>
            <li><p>Classes may have data that we want to treat as internal or private, so we want to limit its exposure to and access from other classes.</p></li>
            <li><p>When making classes, we are starting to think about making reusable components. Thus, to make our code easier to use, we can put it in different files and folders.</p></li>
        </ul>
