        <h2>05 Prepare : Data Structures</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">Stacks</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this study, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Articulate the strengths and weaknesses of Stacks.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use Stacks in Python to solve problems.</p></li>
        </ol>  

        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>

        <p>Please read the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)" target="_BLANK">Wikipedia: Stacks</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Structures for the Common Person</h3>
        <p>With an understanding of the fundamentals of stacks, we now join our commoner, Steve, and his fledgling hamburger stand. Please watch the following short video:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>(Coming soon!) <a href="#" target="_blank">Data structures for the common person - Stacks</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Using Stacks in Python</h3>



        <h3>Homework Assignment</h3>
        <p>Write a program that will read in a file containing three kinds of braces: { }, ( ), and [ ]. Your program should display either "Balanced" or "Not balanced". To be balanced, a file must contain the same number of open braces as closed braces, and they must be closed in the reverse order of how they were opened. You should ignore all whitespace.</p>

        <p>The following are examples of balanced braces:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">
{ ( [ ] ) }

{ }

[ [ [ ( ) ] ] ]
</code></pre>

        <p>The following are examples of braces that are not balanced:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">
{ ( [

{ [ } ]

[ ] ] [
</code></pre>

        <h4>Getting Started</h4>
        <p>You can start with a beginning template by copying it to your current directory:

<pre><code class="bash">
cp /home/cs241/stacks05/braces.py .
</code></pre>

        <h4>TestBed and Submission</h4>
        <p>An automated TestBed script is provided for you. It will test your program on 6 different files.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
testBed cs241/stacks05 braces.py
</code></pre>

        <p>These files should have the following results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>stacks01.txt</code> - Not balanced</li>
            <li><code>stacks02.txt</code> - Balanced</li>
            <li><code>stacks03.txt</code> - Balanced</li>
            <li><code>stacks04.txt</code> - Not balanced</li>
            <li><code>stacks05.txt</code> - Not balanced</li>
            <li><code>stacks06.txt</code> - Balanced</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will not submit your program for grading, instead take the accompanying I-Learn quiz to report on your progress and your understand of stacks.</p>

        <p>You are encouraged to work with others on the programming and the quiz.</p>



        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have a good understanding of this data structure and have completed the programming project, take the accompanying I-Learn Quiz. It has questions about how the data structure works, and also, has places for your to report on the parts of the programming assignment that you completed.</p>
