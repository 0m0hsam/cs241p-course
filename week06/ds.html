        <h2>06 Prepare : Data Structures</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">Queues</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this study, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Articulate the strengths and weaknesses of Queues.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use Queues in Python to solve problems.</p></li>
        </ol>  

        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>

        <p>Please read the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><a href="http://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/queue-data-structure" target="_BLANK">http://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/queue-data-structure</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Structures for the Common Person</h3>
        <p>With an understanding of the fundamentals of queues, we now join our commoner, Steve, and his fledgling hamburger stand. Please watch the following short video:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>(Coming soon!) <a href="#" target="_blank">Data structures for the common person - Queues</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Using Queues in Python</h3>



        <h3>Homework Assignment</h3>


        <p>You are encouraged to work with others on the programming and the quiz.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have a good understanding of this data structure and have completed the programming project, take the accompanying I-Learn Quiz. It has questions about how the data structure works, and also, has places for your to report on the parts of the programming assignment that you completed.</p>
