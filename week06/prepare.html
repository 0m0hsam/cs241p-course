        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this week, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Show fluency in discussing inheritance.</p></li>
            <li><p>Write programs that correctly use inheritance to solve problems.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>
        <p>Please read the following: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-inheritance-in-python-3" target="_blank">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-inheritance-in-python-3</a></p>

        <h3>Supplementary Material</h3>
        <p>In previous semesters, students read about inheritance from the textbook, "Python 3 Object-oriented Programming" by Dusty Phillips. This is available electronically from our library subscription <a href="http://site.ebrary.com/lib/byuidaho/detail.action?docID=10442987#?" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>If you would like, you can reference this electronic textbook for more information about the topics. Here are the appropriate sections:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>From Chapter 1, from the section "Composition and Inheritance" until the end of the chapter. In my copy this is pp. 17-32. This reading presents inheritance at a conceptual level.</p></li>
            <li><p>From Chapter 3, from the beginning until (but not including) Multiple Inheritance. In my copy this is pp. 63-68. This reading demonstrates how to implement inheritance in Python.</p></li>
        </ul>
